1. How do we create the config files (automated)?
2. How does the training vary based on the config file complexity?
3. Can we extract sample files from disgenet or opentargets data?
4. Can we run a large scale comparision on the results between these different methods (for a given set of genes and diseases)?
5. How does this perform on simple vs complex diseases?
6. How does this work for monogenic diseases? (e.g tay sachs or sickle cell)
7. How do we automate this for team members / make a wide variety of results available quickly?
8. Develop a priority list of diseases to run through
	One potential solution is to look at just our E3s and run this to compare for the most common diseases
9. 515 E3s : {df of disease associations}
 	in each df, take the most highly associated diseases (ones that have the most E3s from the list attached)
	run mantis-ml for the top N diseases, manually selecting for the most interesting ones
	run on GCP (takes like 2.5 hours for each disease potentially)
	25 diseases and then see how it compares to disgenet or OT or whatever we go the original source of associations
